I'have built a __Playlist Manager__ Project using the Concept of __DOUBLY LINKED LIST__ in C++
It includes the essential features in My project that are shown below
**🎶 Linked List Playlist Manager 🎶**

This project helped me explore the concepts of:


✅ **Doubly Linked List implementation**

✅ **Insertion at front & back**

✅ **Deletion of nodes (songs)**

✅ **Traversal in both directions (Next / Previous)**

✅ **Managing current pointer like a real music player**


📌 __Features implemented__:

# 1)Add songs (front / back)

# 2)Delete songs

# 3)Display playlist

# 4)Play current / next / previous song

__Overview__:

[Head] <-> Song1 <-> Song2 <-> Song3 <-> [Tail]


               ↑         ↑         ↑

             
    previous song   Current Song   Next Song

👍 __Sample Usage__:

Enter Song Name: Perfect
🎶 Song Added At Back: Perfect

I'have built a Playlist Manager Project using the Concept of *DOUBLY LINKED LIST* in C++
It includes the essential features in My project that are shown below
🎶 Linked List Playlist Manager 🎶

This project helped me explore the concepts of:
✅ Doubly Linked List implementation
✅ Insertion at front & back
✅ Deletion of nodes (songs)
✅ Traversal in both directions (Next / Previous)
✅ Managing current pointer like a real music player

📌 Features implemented:

1)Add songs (front / back)
2)Delete songs
3)Display playlist
4)Play current / next / previous song

Overview:

[Head] <-> Song1 <-> Song2 <-> Song3 <-> [Tail]
